The soft seat type has no allowed criterion of water leakage \u000d\u000aand is designed to be easily installed in both directions. In addition, this can be used in a pure \u000d\u000aliquid state of fluid line as well to replace other kinds of valves already installed, and was \u000d\u000adeveloped to avoid seat leakage even under a pressure of soft seat knife gate v/v 150LB, \u000d\u000a300LB in particular.
